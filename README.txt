This plugin adds a row of "action buttons" to the top of every ticket detail page. These buttons allow you to quickly act on a ticket (with a workflow action like "reassign", "resolve", "reopen", etc) without scrolling down to the Actions section. When a button is pressed, a modal dialog opens up with a small form prompting the user for any additional information (e.g. resolution when resolving the ticket, or new owner when reassigning) and an optional comment.

The plugin does nothing if Javascript is disabled.
